How to use the drivers for WAFS jobs
*********************************************************************

There are 1 standalone UPP job and 5 WAFS jobs
run_JWAFS_UPP
run_JWAFS_GRIB
run_JWAFS_GCIP
run_JWAFS_GRIB2
run_JWAFS_GRIB2_0P25
run_JWAFS_BLENDING_0P25

JWAFS_UPP is a downstream of GFS model outputs in netcdf

JWAFS_GRIB is a downstream of GFS pgrb outputs

JWAFS_GCIP is a downstream of GFS master files, also has satellite and
radar observation data inputs, and METAR SHIP PIREPs data which are dumped
from DCOMROOT by using 'dumpjb'

JWAFS_GRIB2 and JWAFS_GRIB2_0P25 are both a downstream of GFS master files
and JWAFS_UPP outputs

JWAFS_BLENDING_0P25 is a downstream of UK data at DCOM and JWAFS_GRIB2_0P25,
and should be run after JWAFS_GRIB2_0P25

Step 1: source code
=====================
Project location, defined by HOMEwafs
export NWROOT=(the location holds your WAFS local inventory)
export HOMEwafs=${HOMEwafs:-${NWROOT}/{the folder of your WAFS local inventory)}

A user needs to modify NWROOT or HOMEwafs to the project location

Step 2: output and working folder
=====================
Specify COMOUT output folder by setting COMROOT
export COMROOT=(a folder ends with $envir/com)

Change working folder:
export DATA=

Change file names of error messages and script printout:
#PBS -j oe
#PBS -o (your job log file with full path)

Step 3: input data
=====================
Specify date and cycle:
export CDATE=(date as YYYYMMDDHH)
PDY is inferred from CDATE as YYYYMMDD
cyc is inferred from CDATE as HH

Specify COMIN by either setting COMIN or by setting COMPATH used by compath.py
export COMPATH=(location of canned data ending with $envir/com/$RUN structure)
export COMIN=(folder with a full path)

1) run_JWAFS_GRIB2 and run_JWAFS_GRIB2_0P25
Ensure COMPATH includes both GFS and WAFS

2) run_JWAFS_BLENDING_0P25 has two inputs, UK and US.
US data is a downstream product of JWAFS_GRIB2_0P25,
so either:
export COMPATH=($COMROOT/wafs where COMROOT is of run_JWAFS_GRIB2_0P25)
or:
export COMINus=($COMOUT of run_JWAFS_GRIB2_0P25)

UK data is from DCOM,
either:
export DCOMROOT=(a folder canned data with structure of $PDY/wgrbbul/ukmet_wafs)
or:
export COMINuk=${COMINuk:-$DCOMROOT/$PDY/wgrbbul/ukmet_wafs}

3) run_JWAFS_GCIP has 4 inputs: gfs master files of f000 and f003, bufr, satellite and radar
Ensure COMPATH includes GFS

BUFR data is dumped from DCOM.
dumpjb searches data in b000 b001 b003 b004 b007 under $DCOMROOT/$PDY
Though it's optional to modify DCOMROOT for dumping BUFR data, it should be mentioned
DCOMROOT of satellite data may be affected.

Satellite data,
either:
export DCOMROOT=(a folder canned data with structure of $PDY/mcidas)
or:
export COMINsat=${COMINsat:-$DCOMROOT/$PDY/mcidas}

Radar data,
either ensure COMPATH includes radar,
or:
export COMINradar=${COMINradar:-$COMROOT/radarl2/$radarl2_ver)/radar.$PDY}

4) run_JWAFS_UPP and run_JWAFS_GRIB
Ensure COMPATH includes GFS


*********************************************************************
How to test and test results
*********************************************************************
Test by comparing outputs to operational products in different ways.
1) Compared outputs to the operational.
2) Use wgrib2 to check date, cycle and forecast hour are correct.
3) Check the number of fields and records are correct by comparing the
   control files generated by g2ctl
4) Plot and compare by using GrADS to have a sanity check whether
   the differences are reasonable.
